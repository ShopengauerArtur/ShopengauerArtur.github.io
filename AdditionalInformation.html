               <h2>How to start playing board role-playing games</h2>
               <p>At the very least, you need to become familiar with the world of the role-playing game that you intend to play. If this is the Witcher, then it is worth reading the books of the Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. He wrote the saga about the Witcher Geralt. If you want to play dungeons and dragons, then everything is much simpler, since this is a common fantasy, which is presented in the books of Tolkien and many others. It's even easier with the pathfinder. This fantasy was originally invented for a tabletop role-playing game, which means that all the necessary lore is contained in the rulebook.</p>
